**This repository aims to utilize ML and DL to train and identify new putative** *ORI*

In bacteria, the origin of replication (Ori) is typically a well-defined sequence, such as the 232-245 bp region in Escherichia coli, which serves as the initiation site for DNA replication. In eukaryotes like yeast, the Ori is more complex, spanning around 1 kilobase (KB) and involving specific chromatin structures and binding sites. However, for microalgae such as Chlamydomonas, the origin of replication remains largely unknown (several studies have identified the region at chloroplast https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/104/1/1/23430/DNA-replication-in-chloroplasts or for the mitochondria but not with the nuclei per se). This lack of information hinders the development of reliable transformation systems using plasmids, as replication initiation cannot be efficiently controlled without identifying the Ori region. This project aims to uncover the Ori region in Chlamydomonas, facilitating future genetic manipulation and advancing biotechnological applications.

Summary: With microalgae nothing revealed for Ori, therefore no transformation using plasmid is possible.

Bacterial Ori: 232-245 bp (E. coli)

Yeast Ori: 1KB (http://cerevisiae.oridb.org )

If you’re working on developing plasmid systems for microalgae like Chlamydomonas, using yeast-derived systems could be a starting point, but it may require significant optimization and experimentation. Researchers commonly face challenges in transforming the nuclear genome of microalgae, mainly because appropriate replication origins and other regulatory elements are not well understood or documented for these species.

How to find Ori?

Experimental Methods:

Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) Binding Sites: In eukaryotes, the origin recognition complex (ORC) binds to DNA to initiate replication. Experimental techniques such as ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing) can be used to identify ORC binding sites genome-wide, which are typically associated with replication origins.

Replication Timing Profiles: Techniques such as Repli-seq or BrdU-seq can be used to map the replication timing across the genome. Regions that replicate early in S-phase often contain replication origins.

DNA Combing or SMARD (Single Molecule Analysis of Replicated DNA): These are direct, experimental methods to visualize replication origins on single DNA molecules, though they are more labor-intensive.

In Silico Approaches:

While no dedicated tools exist solely for eukaryotic replication origins comparable to prokaryotic Ori-finder, there are computational approaches used in combination with experimental data:

Replication Origin Prediction Algorithms:

OriDB: This is a database specifically for replication origins in eukaryotes, which includes experimental and computationally predicted origins for a variety of organisms like yeast. You might find similar resources for other eukaryotes, though the coverage can be limited depending on the species.

Eukaryotic Replication Origin Database: You can explore databases like this one to see if there is any information about replication origins in species related to your microalgae.

Comparative Genomics:

Motif-Based Analysis: In eukaryotes, replication origins often have certain chromatin features, such as GC-rich regions, open chromatin, and specific histone modifications. You can look for these features using available ChIP-seq or ATAC-seq data in your organism, if available, or in closely related species.

Machine Learning Tools:

Some research groups have developed machine learning models that predict replication origins based on features like sequence composition, histone modifications, and chromatin accessibility. While these models are not yet widespread, tools like (review paper: https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2018.00613  human:https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/25/1/bbad432/7450936)Replicon use machine learning to predict replication timing and origins based on input features.



How to identify Ori of bacteria:
Check Genome Annotations:

GFF or GTF Files: Look for the genome’s General Feature Format (GFF) or Gene Transfer Format (GTF) files. These annotation files contain information about genomic features, including the origin of replication if annotated. You can search for entries labeled as “origin of replication” or similar terms in these files.

RefSeq or GenBank Records: If the genome is available in public databases like RefSeq or GenBank, download the corresponding annotation files. They sometimes explicitly list the origin of replication or indicate regions that may suggest it.

Search for OriC in the Genome Sequence:

Ori-Finding Tools: There are bioinformatics tools designed to identify the origin of replication (OriC) in bacterial and organellar genomes. Some commonly used tools are:

Ori-Finder: A web-based tool that predicts the origin
